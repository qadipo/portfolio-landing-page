# My Portfolio

###### Q Adipo

## Introduction
I am just getting into software engineering. As such I would like to keep track of projects I will be undertaking throughout my learning period.

> Does Learning end anyway? I am told the only time learning stops is when we breath our last! So, seemingly this will serve as an autobiography in the realm of software development.

![Let's keep *learning!*](smile.jpg)

I will be keeping this list for two major reasons:
1. **For you** to appreciate journey
2. **For me** to track my own progress

## Installation
1. Should you wish to try ot what I have done, any text editor will do!
2. Git

Though I would love to learn as many languages as would be useful in my development, the following are the most urgent now:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS - *though I have been told that they are not languages*

In case you know a resource that you deem very useful, or any consideration, do not fail to [email](https://web.facebook.com/)
